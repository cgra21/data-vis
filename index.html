		<h2>Voting frequency vs Income and Education</h2>
		<p><iframe src="categories.html" width="1000" height="800"></iframe></p>
		<p class="text">There seems to be a positive relationship between income and education. As education increases, so does average income.<br>
			There are very few college educated people who make less than $40k and there are very few High school or less educated people who make more than $125k. <br>
			A majority of those making $125k or more are college educated, and a majority of those making $75k-125k have some college education or more. 
			Whereas a majority of people making less than $40k are high school or less educated.</p>

		<p class="text">2020 is widely different from other years, due to the lockdowns from COVID-19, the amount of absentee voters increased dramatically, and we can still see effects from that even in 2021 where the lockdowns were lessened.</p>

			these are all lower than their surrounding counties, which is an interesting trend. </p>
